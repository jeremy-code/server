# Reporting Security Issues

If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in this project, I graciously ask you to please report it to me. I am intently afraid of any malicious intrusions and I promise I will cry if one occurs.

To report a security issue, feel free to use the GitHub Security [" Open a draft security advisory "](https://github.com/jeremy-code/server/security/advisories/new) tab.

Thank you for reviewing my project and I appreciate any help you can provide to ensure the security of my meager project.
